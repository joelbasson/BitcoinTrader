Now, for some questions:

- Something doesn't work.
This might happen. The app should really be considered beta at this point, so keep that in mind if something does break. Just let me know what happened and I'll go about fixing it.

- Why isn't this on the official App Store? You're going to steal all my damn money aren't you?
Nope. The reason is simple: it costs $99 to join the Apple developer program, to be able to have the privilege to submit your app for approval, and I'm an unemployed recent grad who doesn't have a spare $99.
If you're worried about it siphoning off your login information and saving it somewhere, or sending it somewhere, take a gander through the source or run a network sniffer while using the app, you'll see it only ever visits the APIs. Also, it doesn't run in the background, so once you hit the home button, relaunching the app puts you back at a login screen.

- I SCAN in my Mt. Gox account?
Yes. Using Gox's API requires the user having a key and secret, no logins, so when you scan the barcode, the application talks to Gox, get's the key and secret, then asks you for a PIN so it can encrypt them in AES256 and save them on your phone.

- What about scanning for InstaWallet?
No PIN, no encryption on the wallet ID. It's something I can do in future releases, but decided to leave it off now because I think those accounts are meant for temporary use, not to sit on your device for ages.

- How do I get this on my phone?
First off, you must have a JAILBROKEN iPhone. If yours isn't, but you want it to be, it's a fairly simple process, and utilizing your favorite search engine with surely yield positive results. If you don't want to use the version Cydia, then, next, you can download the source, compile and install, if you're familiar with that process. There's also a precompiled .app available in the downloads if you'd rather transfer it yourself.

- I transferred it to my phone, and I restarted the springboard, but it crashes as soon as I click the icon. Wtf?
Make sure you chmod /Applications/BitcoinTrader.app/BitcoinTrader to 755. You can do that through SFTP or SSH.

- I know my username and password are correct, but it keeps saying I can't login. You suck.
That's not really a question, but, before you can use an API, the provider will sometimes make you log in and enable access via their dashboard. So, check that out.

- What's it do?
Spend/receive BTC via QR codes, buy/sell BTC, deposit/withdraw (depending on service), and it provides a full ticker (scrolling and pop-up).

- When using TradeHill, I select an order from the list, and confirm I want to cancel it, it doesn't disappear from the list. What the hell, man?
The Tradehill API only offers one "type" when returning a list of orders, and when you send a cancellation request it can take up to five seconds to be executed on the exchange, therefore the order list that is returned to the client when you cancel an order will still have that order listed as "type" active. Refresh after a few seconds and it should be gone.

- Can I help?
Yes. I need feedback. I've only come across the bitcoin project in the last couple months and I'm not completely familiar with what the needs of a bitcoiner are or what usability options would be most efficient. So, any ideas, suggestions, or bug reports are more than welcome.

- You're awesome. I'm dying to send you some money. Where can I donate?
Aw, that's sweet. Here: 1P1cVNkzwCpJZYQuU37U8s7FvYCRij3JyB
